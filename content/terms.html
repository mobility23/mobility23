			law; (iv) the other Party discontinues its business; (v) a receiver

		<h2>21. Effect Of Termination</h2>

		<p>Other than as required by law, upon termination of the Service
			in accordance with this Agreement, Mobility23 Ltd. shall have no
			further obligation to provide the terminated or any other Service and
			Customer shall have no obligation to pay any further Service Fees
			relating to such terminated Service; provided that, notwithstanding
			such termination, (i) Customer shall remain liable to Mobility23 Ltd.
			for any amounts owed and payable in respect of Service provided prior
			to the effective date of the termination and (ii) the sections of
			this Agreement that have been specifically stated as surviving the
			termination of the Services or sections which would, by their nature,
			survive the termination of the Services, shall survive any such
			termination. Any termination of the obligations under this Agreement
			as to any Service or upon termination of this Agreement will not
			relieve a Party of any liability for breach hereof.</p>

		<h2>22. Miscellaneous</h2>
		<p>(a) Force Majeure</p>
		<p>For purposes of this Section 22 (a), a "Force Majeure Event"
			means an event beyond the control of a Party, which by its nature
			could not have been foreseen by such Party, or, if it could have been
			foreseen, was unavoidable and includes, without limitation, acts of
			God, storms, floods, riots, fires, cloud service provider performance
			failures and/or power outages, power outages, sabotage, civil
			commotion or civil unrest, interference by civil or military
			authorities, and acts of war (declared or undeclared). Continued
			performance of a Service may be suspended immediately to the extent
			caused by Force Majeure. The Party claiming suspension of a Service
			due to Force Majeure will give prompt notice to the other of the
			occurrence of the event giving rise to the suspension and of its
			nature and anticipated duration. The Parties shall cooperate with
			each other to find alternative means and methods for the provision of
			the suspended Service. Without limiting the generality of the
			foregoing, neither Party shall be under any liability for failure to
			fulfill any obligation under these Terms, so long as and to the
			extent to which the fulfillment of such obligation is prevented,
			frustrated, hindered or delayed as a consequence of circumstances of
			Force Majeure.</p>
		<p>(b) Entire Agreement</p>
		<p>This Agreement (including the Mobility23 Service Order
			Confirmation, the Subscription Confirmation and the SAAS Services
			Agreement, whichever is applicable) constitute the entire agreement
			between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
			shall supersede all prior agreements, understandings and
			negotiations, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect
			to the subject matter hereof.</p>
		<p>(c) Transfer of Rights</p>
		<p>Neither Party shall transfer any rights or obligations under
			this Agreement, without the prior written approval of the other
			Party. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, Mobility23 Ltd. has a
			right to transfer such rights and obligations to any affiliate, or to
			a third party as a part of a sale or other transaction involving the
			business to which such rights and obligations relate.</p>
		<p>(d) Severability</p>
		<p>If any terms or other provision of this Agreement or the
			schedules hereto shall be determined by a court, administrative
			agency or arbitrator to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such
			invalidity or unenforceability shall not render the entire Agreement
			invalid. Rather, this Agreement shall be construed as if not
			containing the particular invalid, illegal or unenforceable
			provision, and all other provisions of this Agreement shall
			nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
			or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
			affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon such
			determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
			unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
			this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
			closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
			transactions contemplated hereunder are fulfilled to the fullest
			extent permitted under applicable law.</p>
		<p>(e) Amendment and Modification</p>
		<p>Mobility23 Ltd. has the right to amend the Terms from time to
			time, by notifying Customer of this by email or in the Service. In
			the event that Customer does not approve of the amendment to the
			Terms, Customer has the right to terminate the Service and this
			Agreement prior to the effective date of the amendment.</p>
		<p>(f) No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative</p>
		<p>No failure or delay on the part of either Party hereto in the
			exercise of any right hereunder shall impair such right or be
			construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any
			representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or
			partial exercise of any such right preclude other or further exercise
			thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
			this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
			remedies otherwise available.</p>
		<p>(g) Interpretation</p>
		<p>The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
			purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
			interpretation of these Terms. When a reference is made in this to an
			Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or
			Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.</p>
		<p>(h) Survival of Terms</p>
		<p>Termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason
			shall not release any party from any liabilities or obligations set
			forth in this Agreement which (a) the Parties have expressly agreed
			shall survive any such termination or expiration, or (b) remain to be
			performed, or by their nature would be intended to be applicable
			following any such termination or expiration.</p>
		<p>(i) Independent Contractors</p>
		<p>The relationship of Mobility23 Ltd. and Customer is that of
			independent contractors, and nothing contained in this Agreement
			shall be construed to allow either Party to create or assume any
			obligation on behalf of the other Party for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
		<p>(j) Governing Law and Resolution of Disputes</p>
		<p>This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in
			connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including
			non-contractual disputes or claims) will be governed by and construed
			in accordance with the laws of The United Kingdom, without regard to
			conflict of laws principles. You irrevocably agree that the courts of
			The United Kingdom will have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any
			dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement
			or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual
			disputes or claims).</p>
		<p>(k) Non-Solicitation</p>
		<p>Customer agrees that, during the Term and for a period of
			twelve (12) months thereafter, Customer will not solicit, engage,
			retain or employ, whether directly or indirectly, for any purpose,
			any current employee, contractor, owner or agent of Mobility23 Ltd.</p>

			name and logo in marketing materials, including press releases, and
			Customer agrees to provide references, quotes, reviews as reasonably
			requested from time to time by Mobility23 Ltd. in connection with the
			Customer’s use of the Mobility23 solution. Should the Customer not

		<p>(o) Mobility23 Ltd. may from time to time put in place a
			referral scheme, including requests to various users of the
			Mobility23 platform within a Customer’s organization to refer
			Customers, Suppliers and/or Other Organisations which may benefit
			from the Mobility23 Services. The referral scheme would become active
			only when a referred lead (assuming no prior conversations had taken
			place between Mobility23 Ltd. and the customer in connection with
			Mobility23) became a customer of the Mobility23 Services with a
			minimum 12 month contract duration. Incentives provided as a result
			of referrals including service credits, rebates or monetary
			equivalents (or any other incentive as Mobility23 Ltd. may decide is
			reasonable) will be provided at the sole discretion of Mobility23
			Ltd. and will be provided to the account details (either user
			account, organisation account, bank account or credit card depending
			on the incentive in question). Mobility23 Ltd. may alter or withdraw
			the incentive scheme at any time at its sole discretion. Customer
			agrees that any internal distribution of incentives relating to
			referrals (within Customer’s organization) is a matter concerning
			only the Customer’s organization and not Mobility23 Ltd. in any way
			or any of its affiliates.</p>
